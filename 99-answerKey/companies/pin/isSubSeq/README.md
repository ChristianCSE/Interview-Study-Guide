# Success! 
NOTE: It is asking for the existence of a subsequence; hence, we don't 
care about length. In other words, we just care if the subsequence
exists wrt order. 



# Fails DP :shit:
Passes 12/12 cases but there is a memory limit exceeded fault. 
I don't post the fail case due to it containing an extremely long string which takes forever to load. 
I can post the s string: 

String s = ""gggsgguggggbsggggggggggggggggggggegggggggggggqgugggegggggggggggggggngggggggcggggggggggggeggggggggggg""
