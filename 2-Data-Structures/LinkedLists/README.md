#Linked Lists 
<h3>Types:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Singly Linked List</li>
<li>Doubly Linked List</li>
<li>Circular Linked List</li>
<li> Linked List
  <ul>
  <li>This is an abstract class that defines the general skeleton for linked lists. In other words, these are conventional methods required in Linked Lists: Circular, Linear, and Doubly. </li>
  <li>I need to make this just a single abstract class in order for it to work universally, hence any methods that are distinct to a Linked List Type will not be included. </li>
  <li>All the ___Task.java classes have some similar required functionality; hence I might make an Abstract Class for this as well.</li>
  </ul>
